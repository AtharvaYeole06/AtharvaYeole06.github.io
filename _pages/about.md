    Computer Science Undergraduate  
    MIT Manipal



am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the Manipal Institute of Technology (MIT Manipal). My academic journey has been driven by a deep curiosity about how computational systems can be designed, optimized, and applied to solve complex real-world problems. Over time, this curiosity has evolved into a strong inclination toward research, particularly in areas that bridge theoretical foundations with practical innovation.
